# ValueGuard - 17c Diminished Value Calculator

**Empowering car owners to fight for fair insurance payouts.**

## 🎯 Mission

ValueGuard calculates the diminished value payout insurance companies don't want you to know about using the industry-standard **17c Formula**. We combine consumer advocacy with data-driven precision to help you recover what you're owed.

## 🧮 The 17c Formula

```
Diminished Value = Base Value × 10% Cap × Damage Multiplier × Mileage Multiplier
```

### Damage Multipliers

- **Major Damage (Frame/Airbag):** 0.75
- **Moderate Damage:** 0.50
- **Minor Damage:** 0.25
- **No Structural Damage:** 0.00

### Mileage Multipliers
- **0 - 19,999 miles:** 1.00
- **20,000 - 39,999:** 0.80
- **40,000 - 59,999:** 0.60
- **60,000 - 79,999:** 0.40
- **80,000 - 99,999:** 0.20
